        <h3>Moving around Boston</h3>
        <p>Now there are a few ways you can move around Boston:</p>
        <ol><li>You can just walk, if you want to put in those steps. Boston is a fairly walkable city, so put on some sneakers.</li>
            <li>Buy a bus, or subway ticket at the <a href="https://www.mbta.com/">MBTA website</a>, or buy at any of the train stations in the city.</li>
        </ol>
